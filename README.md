# Task-Prep-LeanIX-Internal
Adapting a python script to fetch certain user Data from a Demo Workspace.
I created the API Token from the Demo Workspace i was given access to.
Added the Token as well as the workspace id to the forementioned file.
added a few changes to the print fuction of the data being called through authentication of the API Token with the URL.
Thus was able to generate a list containing the users data.
I was unable to get the last/currentLogin of the users on the website.
